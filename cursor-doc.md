# üå™Ô∏è Jinn ‚Äì Joint Intelligence Non-Profit Network

**Jinn** is a non-profit, open-source platform to simulate financial risk and economic systems.  
We are building **public infrastructure** for civic foresight‚Äîtools that allow anyone to model and understand systemic shocks without relying on private black-box systems.

## üß≠ Mission

> Build an open simulation engine for financial risk that is modular, transparent, and accessible to the public.

The goal of this MVP is to create a **minimal, working simulation engine** that:
- Accepts structured input (JSON)
- Applies a basic financial model
- Outputs an interpreted result (e.g. change in GDP)
- Can be expanded with more models in the future

---

## ‚úÖ MVP Focus

### Title: **Interest Rate Shock Model**

The MVP models the effect of a change in interest rates on national GDP using a simplified formula.

### Input (JSON):
- `gdp`: total GDP in USD
- `interest_rate_change`: percent increase or decrease

### Output (JSON):
- New GDP estimate
- GDP change
- Assumptions used
