**Jinn** – *Joint Intelligence Non-Profit Network* – is an open-source platform to simulate financial risk and economic systems for the public good.

We are building a **transparent, auditable, and decentralized infrastructure** for understanding the economic forces that shape our lives—designed for communities, researchers, and public institutions, not just corporations.
